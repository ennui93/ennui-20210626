# ennui
At present, this repo is primarily targeted at running a minimalist Gentoo installation on x86_64 with GNU glibc sans X, dbus, systemd, or any sound servers.

## musl
Originally, this was an overlay for Gentoo Linux supporting musl as a libc. That use of this repo is deprecated at present, though it may return in the future.

This would provide ebuilds supplementary to those at https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/musl.git.

See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened_musl for more information.
